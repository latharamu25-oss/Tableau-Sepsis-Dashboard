## Sepsis Data Analysis
### Project Overview

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the bodyâ€™s overwhelming response to infection, leading to widespread inflammation, organ failure, and potentially death. It affects millions worldwide each year and remains a leading cause of hospital mortality. This project focuses on analyzing clinical data to uncover early indicators, trends, and risk factors associated with sepsis.

### Objective

To apply data analytics and visualization techniques to identify early warning signs and improve understanding of sepsis progression and outcomes.

### Tools & Technologies

**SQL:** Data extraction, cleaning, and joining of hospital datasets

**Tableau:** Interactive dashboards visualizing sepsis trends, patient vitals, and outcomes

**Excel:** Data preprocessing and basic statistical analysis

## Key Tasks

Queried and cleaned patient data using SQL to ensure data consistency and reliability.

Analyzed vital signs, infection markers, and clinical outcomes to detect early patterns.

Built Tableau dashboards to visualize patient risk levels, sepsis incidence, and mortality trends.

## Key Insights

Early variations in temperature, heart rate, and white blood cell count strongly correlated with sepsis onset.

Timely administration of antibiotics and fluid resuscitation significantly improved survival rates.

Data-driven visualization helped highlight high-risk cases for proactive clinical decisions.

## Outcome

This analysis demonstrates how data-driven insights can support early diagnosis, treatment optimization, and hospital response improvement for sepsis management.

## Next Steps

Integrate predictive modeling using Python (logistic regression, random forest).

Automate dashboard updates for real-time monitoring.
